# Visual Domain Knowledge-based Multimodal Zoning Textual Region Localization in Noisy Historical Document Images
This repository contains the implementation of zoning solution based on multimodal approach using our novel visual representation, *Gravity-map*. The model predicts textual regions in a set of closed polygons on a document image. The underlying CNN model used in our solution is [dhSegment](https://dhsegment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
